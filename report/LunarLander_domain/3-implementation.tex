\section{Detailed Implementation}
\label{section:implementation}
Please explain your implementation in detail. You may do this with the help of pseudo code or a figure of system architecture. Please also highlight which parts of the algorithm lead to the most difficulty in your implementation.

\subsection*{Experiment Settings}
The paper's settings:
\begin{itemize}
    \item network: a hidden layer comprised of 16 units with RELU activation functions + a second layer with 16 units and softmax activation functions
    \item use REINFORCE to train the network
    \item batch episode size: 10
    \item learning rate = 0.005
    \item optimizer: Adam
    \item do 10 experiments
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Boltzmann softmax: $\beta=1,2,3,5,10$
        \item Mellowmax: $\omega=3,5,7,8,11$
    \end{itemize}
    \item each experiments do 400 runs, each runs train 40000 episodes
\end{itemize}
Our expiriment settings are basically the same as the paper's, the only different is we do each experiment 3 runs (seed=22, 321, 7654), each run trains 15000 episodes.
Because the training needs a lot of time, so we simplified this part.
