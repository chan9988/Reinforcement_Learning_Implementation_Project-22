\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion}
The whole survey and replication through the paper could summarize the advantages of mellowmax in the following points:
\begin{itemize}
\item The non-expansion property: the convergence of GVI is guaranteed
\item more stable during the training
\end{itemize}
and the disadvantages of mellowmax is that:
\begin{itemize}
\item Using mellowmax softmax operator may need more time to solve beta, but may get better updates during training.
\end{itemize}
This paper proposed the mellowmax operator as an alternative to the Boltzmann softmax operator. We also replicated that mellowmax has several desirable properties and that it works favorably in practice. Arguably, mellowmax could be used in place of Boltzmann throughout reinforcement-learning research.
