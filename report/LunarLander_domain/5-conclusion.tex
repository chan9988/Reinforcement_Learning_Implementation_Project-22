\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion}
Please provide succinct concluding remarks for your report. You may discuss the following aspects:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The potential future research directions
    \item Any technical limitations: The Mellowmax method needs more time to solve beta, In LunarLander,
    it takes about 0.0014 sec per step with Boltzmann softmax and 0.0046 sec per step with Mellomax.

    \item Any latest results on the problem of interest
\end{itemize}
